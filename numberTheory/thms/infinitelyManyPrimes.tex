\begin{thm}
\label{thm:infinitelyManyPrimes}
  There are infinitely many primes.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose otherwise.
  That is, there exists finitely many primes.
  As there are finitely many primes, we may enumerate them as \[ p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n\] for some $n\in\NN$.
  Set, \[ P := p_1 p_2\cdots p_n\,.\]

  Let $i$ any integer with $1\leq i\leq n$.
  As $P= p_1 p_2\cdots p_n$, $p_i|P$.
  Thus, by Proposition \ref{prop:consecutiveIntegersNotDivisibleBySamePrime}, $p\nmid(P+1)$.
  Thus, $P+1$ is not divisible by any prime $p_i$.
  Though, the $p_i$ enumerate all of the primes, so $P+1$ is not divisible by a prime.

  As $P+1$ is not divisible by any prime, the Fundamental Theorem Of Arithmetic provides, the prime factorization of $P+1$ is itself.
  Whence, $P+1$ itself is prime.
  Though, there does not exist an $i$ with $1\leq i\leq n$ such that $p_i = P+1$, as shown earlier.
  Thus the prime $P+1$ is not on our list of all primes, contradicting that we listed all of the primes.
  Thus, there are infinitely many primes.
\end{proof}
