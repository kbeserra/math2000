  Let $n$ be an integer and $d$ a positive integer.
  Then the Quotient Remainder Theorem, Theorem \ref{thm:quotientRemainderTheorem}, applies, and there exists unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that $0\leq r<d$ and $n=qd+r$.
  We define \[n\bmod d = q\text~~{ and }~~n\bdiv d = r\] to denote the integer quotient and remainder after division by $d$ respectively.
