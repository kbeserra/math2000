\begin{prop}
\label{prop:noIntegerBothEvenAndOdd}
  No integer is both even and odd.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose, towards a contradiction, that there is an integer which is both even and odd.
  Let $n\in\ZZ$ be such an integer.
  As $n$ is both even and odd, there exists $a,b\in\ZZ$ such that \[ 2a=n=2b+1\,.\]
  Though,
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
    && n &=n \\
    &\implies\quad & 2a &= 2b + 1 \\
    &\implies\quad & 2a-2b &= 1 \\
    &\implies\quad & a-b &= \frac{1}{2}\\
    &&&\not\in\ZZ
  \end{alignat*}

  Though, as $a,b\in\ZZ$ $a-b\in\ZZ$, a contradiction.
  Whence, there is no integer which is both even and odd.
\end{proof}
