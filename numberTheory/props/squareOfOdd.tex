\begin{prop}
\label{prop:squareOfOdd}
  The square of an odd integer has the form $8m+1$ for some $m\in\ZZ$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Fix $n\in\ZZ$ odd.
  Using the Quotient Remainder Theorem, we hav have that $n$ has the form $4q+r$ for some $q,r\in\ZZ$ and $0\leq r<4$.
  As $n=4q+r$ is odd, $r\not=0,2$.
  So, $r=1$ or $r=3$.

  In the case that $r=1$, then $n=4q+1$.
  So,
  \begin{align*}
    n^2 &= (4q+1)^2 \\
        &= 16q^2 + 8q + 1 \\
        &= 8(2q^2+q) + 1\,.
  \end{align*}
  Note that as $q\in\ZZ$ $2q^2+q\in\ZZ$.
  Thus, $n^2$ has the desired form.

  In the case that $r=1$, then $n=4q+3$ we have that
  \begin{align*}
    n^2 &= (4q+3)^2 \\
        &= 16q^2 + 24q + 9 \\
        &= 16q^2 + 24q + 8 + 1 \\
        &= 8(2q^2+3q+1) + 1\,.
  \end{align*}
  Note that as $q\in\ZZ$ $2q^2+3q+1\in\ZZ$.
  Thus, $n^2$ has the desired form.
\end{proof}
