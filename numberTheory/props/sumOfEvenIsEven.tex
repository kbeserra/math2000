\begin{prop}
\label{prop:sumOfEvenIsEven}
  Show taht the sum of two even integers is even.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Let $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary even integers.
  As $a$ and $b$ are even there exists $k,l\in\ZZ$ such that $a=2k$ and $b=2l$.
  Then, we note that
  \begin{align*}
    a + b &= 2k + 2l \\
          &= 2( k + l )\,.
  \end{align*}
  Though, as $k,l\in\ZZ$, $k+l\in\ZZ$, set $m=k+l$.
  Then we note that $m\in\ZZ$ and $a+b = 2m$, and whence $a+b$ is even.
\end{proof}
