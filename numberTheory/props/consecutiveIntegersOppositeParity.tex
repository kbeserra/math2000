\begin{prop}
\label{prop:integersAreEvenXorOdd}
  Any pair of consecutive integers have opposite parity.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Fix $n\in\ZZ$ arbitrary.
  Using Proposition \ref{prop:integersAreEvenXorOdd}, $m$ is either even or odd.

  Case 1: $m$ is even.
  As $m$ is even $m=2k$ for some $k$.
  So, $m+1 = 2k+1$, so $m+1$ is odd.
  Thus, $m$ and $m+1$ have opposite parity.


  Case 2: $m$ is odd.
  As $m$ is even $m=2k$+1 for some $k$.
  So, $m+1 = 2(k+1)$, so $m+1$ is even.
  Thus, $m$ and $m+1$ have opposite parity.
\end{proof}
