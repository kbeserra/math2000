\begin{prop}
\label{prop:divisorsOf1}
  The divisors of $1$ are $1$ and $-1$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Note that $1=1\cdot 1=-1\cdot-1$.
  So, $-1,1\vert 1$.

  Now, it suffices to show that $\forall m\in\ZZ( m\vert 1\rightarrow m=1,-1)$.
  Suppose $m\in\ZZ$ and $m\vert 1$.
  As $m\vert 1$ there exists $n\in\ZZ$ such that $mn=1$
  We note that either $m$ and $n$ are both positive, or both negative.


  Case 1. $m$ and $n$ are both positive.
    Then Proposition \ref{prop:positiveDividesImpliesNotGreater}, $m\leq 1$.
    But, $m$ is positive, so $0<m\leq 1$.
    Finally, as $m\in\ZZ$ and $0<m\leq 1$, $m=1$.


  Case 2. $m$ and $n$ are both negative.
    Then $(-m)(-n)=mn=1$.
    So, $-m$ and $-n$ are positive.
    Thus, the previous case gives that $-m=1$.
    Whence, $m=-1$.
\end{proof}
