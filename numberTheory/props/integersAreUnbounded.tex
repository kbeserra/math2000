\begin{prop}
\label{prop:integersAreUnbounded}
  There is no greatest integer.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose, towards a contradiction, that there is a greatest integer.
  That is, there exists some $n\in\ZZ$ such that $\forall m\in\ZZ$ $m\leq n$.
  Consider $n+1$.
  As $\ZZ$ is closed under successors, the operation $\cdot\mapsto\cdot+1$, $n+1\in\ZZ$.
  Though, $n\lneq n+1$ contradicting our assumption of $n$.
  Thus, there is not greatest integer.
\end{proof}
