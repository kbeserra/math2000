%TODO show the integers are closed under addition and multiplication.
%TODO show multiplication over the integers is commutative.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:sumOfRaionalsIsRational}
  If $r$ and $s$ are rational, then $r+s$ is rational.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Fix $r$ and $s$ rational.
  This means, by Definition \ref{defn:rational}, there exists $a,b,c,d\in\ZZ$ with $b,d\not=0$ such that $sb=a$ and $rd=c$.
  Note that as $a,b,c,d\in\ZZ$, $ad+bc,bd\in\ZZ$ and as $b,d\not=0$ $bd\not=0$.
  Finally, we see that
  \begin{align*}
    bd(s+r) &= bds + bdr \\
            &= da + bc\,.
  \end{align*}
  Thus, by Definition \ref{defn:rational}, $s+r$ is rational.
\end{proof}
