%TODO show multiplication is of positive integers is non-decreasing.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:positiveDividesImpliesNotGreater}
  For any integers $a$ and $b$ if $a$ and $b$ are positive and $a\vert b$, then $a\leq b$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Fix $a,b\in\ZZ$ such that $a$ and $b$ are positive and $a\vert b$.
  As $a\vert b$ there exists $k\in\ZZ$ such that $b=ak$.
  As $a,b>0$, $\frac{b}{a}>0$, thus \[ 0 < \frac{b}{a}=k\,.\]
  Whence, $k>0$.
  As $k\in\ZZ$ and $k>0$, $k\geq 1$.
  Finally, we have \[ a \leq ka = b \].
\end{proof}
