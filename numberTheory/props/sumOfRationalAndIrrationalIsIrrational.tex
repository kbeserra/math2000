\begin{prop}
\label{prop:sumOfRationalAndIrrationalIsIrrational}
  The sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose towards a contradiction that this is false.
  Thus, there exists a rational $r$ and an irrational $s$ so that $r+s$ is rational.
  Though, as $r$ is rational by Proposition \ref{prop:productOfRaionalsIsRational}, $-r$ is rational.
  Further, as $r+s$ and $-r$ are ration applying Proposition \ref{prop:sumOfRaionalsIsRational}, $r+s+(-r)=s$ is rational, a contradiction.
\end{proof}
