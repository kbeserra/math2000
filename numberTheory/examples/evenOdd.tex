%TODO Show that $\ZZ$ is closed under $+$ and $*$.
The following exercise is incomplete, it requires the fact that $\ZZ$ is closed under $+$ and $*$.
Currently, that fact is asserted without proof.

\begin{exmp}
\label{exmp:evenOdd}
  Use the definitions for even and odd, Definitions \ref{defn:even} and \ref{defn:odd}, to justify that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $0$ is even.\\
      Note that $0\in\ZZ$ and $0 = 2(0)$, thus by Definition \ref{defn:even} $0$ is even.
    \item $-301$ is odd.\\
      Note that $-151\in\ZZ$ and $-301=2(-151) + 1$, thus by Definition \ref{defn:odd} $-301$ is odd.
    \item if $a,b\in\ZZ$, then $6a^2b$ is even.\\
      Fix $a,b\in\ZZ$.
      Note that as $\ZZ$ is closed under $*$ and $3\in\ZZ$, $3*a^2b=3aab\in\ZZ$.
      Similarly, as $6\in\ZZ$ $6a^2b\in\ZZ$
      Thus, by Definition \ref{defn:even} $6a^2b=2(3a^2b)$ is even.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exmp}
