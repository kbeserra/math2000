\begin{lem}
\label{lem:positiveNotUnitIntegerPrimeOrProductOfPrimes}
  Every integer $n>1$ is either prime or a product of primes.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  We show this via strong induction on $n$.
  For the base case, where $n=2$, we note that $2$ is prime.
  Thus, the claim holds at $n=2$.

  Now, suppose that $n>1$ and every integer $m>n$ is either prime or a product of primes.
  If $n$ is prime, there is noting to show.
  Otherwise $n$ is not prime, so by Lemma \ref{lem:notPrimeIsComposite} $n$ is composite.
  Thus, there exists $r,s\in\ZZ$ such that $1<r,s<n$.
  Though, as $1<r,s<n$ our inductive hypothesis applies to $r$ and $s$, so $r$ and $s$ are a product of primes.
  Whence, $n=rs$ is a product of primes.
\end{proof}
