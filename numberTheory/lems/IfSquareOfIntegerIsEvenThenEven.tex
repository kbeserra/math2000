\begin{lem}
\label{lem:IfSquareOfIntegerIsEvenThenEven}
  For every integer $n$ if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Fix $n\in\ZZ$ and suppose that $n$ is not even.
  As $n$ is not even, we have by Proposition \ref{prop:integersAreEvenXorOdd} that $n$ is odd.
  As $n$ is odd, there exists $k\in\ZZ$ such that $n=2k+1$.
  So,
  \begin{align*}
    n^2 &= (2k+1)^2 \\
        &= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \\
        &= 2(2k^2+2k) + 1\,,
  \end{align*}
  showing $n^2$ is odd.
  Again, by Proposition \ref{prop:integersAreEvenXorOdd}, as $n^2$ is odd $n^2$ is not even.
\end{proof}
