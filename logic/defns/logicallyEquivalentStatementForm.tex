\begin{defn}
\label{defn:logicallyEquivalentStatementForm}
\index{logically equivalent statement form}
  Two statement forms are said to be \emph{logically equivalent} if, and only if, they have identical truth values for each possible truth value assignment for their statement variables.
  Let $P$ and $Q$ be statement forms, we write $P \equiv Q$ to mean that $P$ is logically equivalent to $Q$.
