\begin{defn}
\label{defn:universalConditionalStatement}
\index{universal conditional statement}
	An \emph{universal conditional statement} is a statement asserting that that for any $x\in D$ such that $P(x)$, $Q(x)$ holds as well.
	Written $\forall x\in D(P(x)\rightarrow Q(x) )$, where  $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are predicates and $D$ is the domain of $x$ in $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$.
	$\forall x\in D(P(x)\rightarrow Q(x))$ is true if, and only if, $P(x)\rightarrow Q(x)$ is true for every $x$ in $D$.
