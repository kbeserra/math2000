\begin{defn}
\label{defn:negationOfStatement}
  Let $p$ be a statement.
  The \emph{negation} of $p$, written $\neg p$, is the statement with the opposite truth value.
\end{defn}

Note, the symbol $\neg$ is not the only symbol used to denote negation.
For instance, it is not uncommon to see the symbol $\sim$ used in other logic texts.
Further, many c-like programming-languages will use the symbol $!$ for the same meaning.
The Python programming-language deserves a special call-out on this note, it allows for the use of the symbol `not' for its not symbol (which fits nicely with its use of `and' and `or' for its and \& or logical connectives).
