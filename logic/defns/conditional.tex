\begin{defn}
\label{defn:conditionalStatement}
\index{conditional}
  Let $p$ and $q$ be statements forms.
  The \emph{conditional statement} ``$p$ implies $q$'', written $p \rightarrow q$, is the statement form that is false precisely when $p$ is true and $q$ is false ( that is, when the statement ``If $p$, then $q$'' is violated ).

  In the conditional $p\rightarrow q$, $p$ is refered to as the \emph{hypothesis} and $q$ is called the \emph{conclusion}.
