\index{extistential statement}
	An \emph{extistential statement} is a statement asserting that that $P(x)$ holds for any one $x$ in $D$, written $\exists x\in D(P(x))$, where  $P(x)$ is a predicate and $D$ is the domain of $x$ in $P(x)$.
	$\exists x\in D(P(x))$ is true if, and only if, there exists an $x$ in $D$ such that is true.
