\index{universal statement}
	An \emph{universal statement} is a statement asserting that that $P(x)$ holds for every $x$ in $D$, written $\forall x\in D(P(x))$, where  $P(x)$ is a predicate and $D$ is the domain of $x$ in $P(x)$.
	$\forall x\in D(P(x))$ is true if, and only if, $P(x)$ is true for every $x$ in $D$.
