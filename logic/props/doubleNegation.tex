\begin{prop}
\label{prop:doubleNegation}
  {\bf (Double negation):}
  The statement form $p$ is logically equivalent to $\neg\neg p$, i.e. $p\equiv \neg\neg p$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  In the truth table below, we will write $\neg\neg p$ and $\neg(\neg p)$.
  This is to highlight that we are negating the statement form $\neg p$.
  \begin{center}
    \input{ |"python3 logic/scripts/generateTruthTable.py '!p' '!(!p)' "}
  \end{center}
  We note that the column for $p$ is identical to the column for $\neg\neg p$.
  Thus, we can conclude that after substituting a statement for the statement variable $p$ in the statement forms $p$ and $\neg\neg p$ the statement forms will have identical truth values.
  Whence, the statement forms are identical.
\end{proof}

The conclusion of the previous definition is certainly a mouthful, but worth repeating.
Similar to the way statement forms provide a layer of abstraction to statements, examining the truth tables of two statement forms to determine equivalence abstracts away substituting actual statements for statement variables.
