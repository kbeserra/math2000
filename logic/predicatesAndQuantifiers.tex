\section{Predicates and Quantifiers}
\label{sec:predicatesAndQuantifiers}

Note the sentence
  \begin{center}
    ``They are a college student.''
  \end{center}
  is not a statement as it may be true or false depending on the value of ``They''.
In this sentence ``They'' is a free variable.
Similarly, ``$x+y>0$'' is not a statement, it has more familiar variables $x$ and $y$.

The predicate refers to the part of the sentence with some or all of its nouns removed.
That is, in the sentence
  \begin{center}
    ``James is a student at the University of North Texas.'',
  \end{center}
  ``James'' is the subject and
  \begin{center}
    ``is a student at the University of North Texas.''
  \end{center}
  is the predicate.

In logic, predicates are formed in much the same way.
\input{logic/examples/predicates.tex}
In Example \ref{exmp:predicates}, we referred to the example's predicates with their full names, $P(x)$ and $Q(x,y)$.
When there is no room for confusion and the variables or other ornaments are of little importance to the statement being made, we may drop those decorations from the symbol.
That is, the concluding sentence of Example \ref{exmp:predicates} could be written ``Whence, $P$ and $Q$ are predicates.''.
