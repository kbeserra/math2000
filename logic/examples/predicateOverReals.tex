\begin{exmp}
\label{exmp:predicateOverReals}
  Let $P(x)$ denote ``$x^2 > x$'' with $\RR$, the set of real numbers, as the domain of $x$.

  $P(2)$ and $P(-\frac{1}{2})$ are true.
  This is because $P(2)$ and $P(-\frac{1}{2})$ denote the statments ``$4 > 2$'' and ``$\frac{1}{4} > -\frac{1}{2}$'' respectively.
  On the other hand, $P(\frac{1}{2})$, which is the statement ``$\frac{1}{4}>\frac{1}{2}$'' is false.
