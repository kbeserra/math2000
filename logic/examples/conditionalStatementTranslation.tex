\begin{exmp}
\label{exmp:conditionalStatementTranslation}
  Rewrite the following as an if-then statement (in English):
  \begin{center}
    ``Either you get your work in on time or you're fired.''.
  \end{center}

  Let $\neg p$ be the statement ``you get your work in on time''.
  This means that $p$ is equivalent to the statement `` you do not get your work in on time''
  Let $q$ the statement ``you are fired''.
  Then the original statement can be written as $\neg p\vee q$.
  Using Proposition \ref{prop:conditionEquivalence}, we have that $\neg p\vee q \equiv p\rightarrow q$.
  Rewriting this in English we get:
  \begin{center}
    ``If you do not get your work in on time, then you are fired.''.
  \end{center}
\end{exmp}
