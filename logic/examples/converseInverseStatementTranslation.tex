\begin{exmp}
\label{exmp:converseInverseStatementTranslation}
  Write (in English) the converse and inverse of:
  \begin{center}
      ``If today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, then tomorrow is Tuesday.''.
  \end{center}

  Just as in Example \ref{exmp:contrapositiveStatementTranslation}, let $p$ be the statement ``today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day'' and $q$ the statement ``tomorrow is Tuesday''.
  So, $\neg p$ is equivalent to the statement ``today is not Martin Luther King Jr. Day'' and $\neg q$ is the statement ``tomorrow is not Tuesday''

  Finally, the from Definition \ref{defn:converse}, the converse of the original statement is $q \rightarrow p$ or in English:
  \begin{center}
      ``If tomorrow is Tuesday, then today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day.''.
  \end{center}
  And, using Definition \ref{defn:inverse} the inverse of the original statement is $\neg p \rightarrow \neg q$ or in English:
  \begin{center}
      ``If today is not Martin Luther King Jr. Day, then tomorrow is not Tuesday.''.
  \end{center}
\end{exmp}
