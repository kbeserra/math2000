\begin{exmp}
\label{exmp:existentialStatementOverReals}
\index{witness}
	Show that $\exists x\in \RR(x = x^2)$ is true.

	To do this, we need to recall that $\exists x\in \RR(x = x^2)$ is true, by Definition \ref{defn:extistentialStatement}, precisely when $x= x^2$ for some $x\in \RR$.
	So, we must find a \emph{witness} which sees that $x=x^2$ is true.

	For such a witness, consider $x=1$ and note that$x=1=1=x^2$.
