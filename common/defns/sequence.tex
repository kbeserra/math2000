\begin{defn}
\label{defn:sequence}
\index{sequence}
\index{term}
\index{index}
  A \emph{sequence} is a function whose domain is some subset of $\NN$.
  For a sequence $s$, we typically write $s_i$ in place of $s(i)$.
  We refer to an individual value, $s_i$, as a \emph{term} in the sequence and $i$ as the \emph{index} of that term
\end{defn}

\index{explicit formula for sequence}
For a sequence $s$, an \emph{explicit formula} of $s$ is a rule or formula which depends on the index of the sequence.
