\begin{prop}
\label{prop:evenPowersOf2Minus1DivisibleBy3}
  For all $n\in\NN$ $2^{2n}-1$ is divisible by $3$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  We prove this by induction on $n\in\NN$.

  If $n=0$, then
  \begin{align*}
    2^{2n}-1  &= 2^{2\cdot0}-1 \\
              &= 1 - 1
              &= 0\,.
  \end{align*}
  Though, as $0 = 3\cdot 0$, we have that $2^{2\cdot 0}-1$ is divisible by $3$.

  Now, suppose that $n\in\NN$ is such that $2^{2n}-1$ is divisible by $3$.
  As $2^{2n}-1$ is divisible by $3$, there exists some $a\in\ZZ$ so that $3a = 2^{2n}-1$.
  Now,
  \begin{align*}
    2^{2(n+1)}-1  &= 2^{2n+2} - 1 \\
                  &= 2^{2n}4 - 1 \\
                  &= 2^{2n}(3+1) - 1 \\
                  &= 3\cdot 2^{2n} + 2^{2n} - 1 \\
                  &= 3\cdot 2^{2n} + 3a \\
                  &= 3( 2^{2n} + a )\,.
  \end{align*}
  So, as $2^{2n}+a\in\ZZ$ $3|2^{2(n+1)}-1$.
\end{proof}
