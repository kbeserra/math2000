Throughout this text we will denote:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\NN$ as the set of natural numbers, these are the non-negative whole numbers.
    Note, $0$ is a natural number.
  \item $\ZZ$ as the set of integers.
  \item $\QQ$ as the set of rational numbers.
  \item $\RR$ as the set of real numbers.
  \item $\CC$ as the set of complex numbers.
\end{itemize}

By $\ZZ^+$ and $\ZZ^-$, we mean the set of all positive and negative integers respectively.
By $\ZZ^{\geq 0}$ and $\ZZ^{\leq 0}$, we mean the set of all non-negative and non-positive integers respectively.
Similarly, we may replace the set of integers, $\ZZ$ in the previous with $\QQ$ or $\RR$ for the same meaning.
Note that as positive and negative are not defined on the complex plane, we cannot do the same for $\CC$.
