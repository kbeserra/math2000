The principle of mathematical induction is:
\index{weak induction}
Let $P(n)$ some predicate where the domain of $n$ is the integers, or some subset of the integers.
Let $a\in\ZZ$ be some fixed value, and suppose that for all $c\geq a$, $c$ is in the domain of $n$ in $P(n)$.
Then, if
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $P(a)$ is true and
  \item $\forall k\geq a$ if $P(k)$ is true, then $P(k+1)$ is true,
\end{enumerate}
then $\forall k\geq a(P(k))$ is true.
This is known as \emph{weak induction}.
Proofs by induction generally follow a common pattern.
\index{base step}
\index{inductive step}
\index{inductive hypothesis}
First, the proof shows (1) holds, this is known as the \emph{base step}.
Second, the proof shows (2), which is called the \emph{inductive step}.
During the inductive step, the assumption that $P(k)$ holds for some fixed $k\geq a$ is called the \emph{inductive hypothesis}.

Put simply, if $P(n)$ is some predicate with the variable $n$ an integer, then if we can show that $P(a)$ holds for some starting value and that $P$ holding at some value implies that $P$ holds at the next value, then $P$ holds at every value greater that or equal to the base value.

You can think of this as a line of dominos standing upright so that if you knock down one domino, then that domino knocks down its neighbor.
Mathematical induction is saying that, in this scenario, if you knock down the first domino, then all of the dominos will be knocked down!

We will see many examples of induction in the future.
