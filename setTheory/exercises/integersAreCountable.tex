\label{exercise:paritionOfIntegers}
  Show that the map described in the proof of Proposition \ref{prop:integersAreCountable} is a bijection which
  \begin{itemize}
    \item has $0$ as a fixed point,
    \item maps the negative integers to the even natural numbers, and
    \item the positive integers to the odd natural numbers.
  \end{itemize}
