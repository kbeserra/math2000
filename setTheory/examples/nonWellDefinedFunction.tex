\begin{exmp}
\label{exmp:nonWellDefinedFunction}
  Define $f:\RR\to\RR$ by for each $x\in X$, $f(x)=y$ where $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.
  Note, this described $f$ is not a function as for almost all $x\in\RR$ there either does not exist such a $y$ or there exists $2$ such $y$.
  In fact, the described $f$ is a function precisely on the set $\set{-1,1}$ as is not particularly interesting at those values.
