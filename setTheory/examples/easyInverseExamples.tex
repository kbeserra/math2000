\begin{exmp}
\label{exmp:easyBijectionExamples}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute $f^{-1}$ given $f(x) = 4x-1$.\\

    First, we performa sanity check and ask if $f^{-1}$ makes sense given our function $f$.
    As we showed in Example \ref{exmp:easyBijectionExamples}, $f$ as above is a bijection.
    So, this by Proposition \ref{prop:existenceOfInverseFunction} $f^{-1}$ does exists.
    In fact, we have computed the inverse already, in Example \ref{exmp:easySurjectiveExamples}, it is \[ f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y+1}{4}\,.\]

    \item Compute the inverse of the function $g(x,y) = (x+y,x-y)$.\\

    Again, we have already shown that this $g$ is a bijection.
    Further, in Example \ref{exmp:easyBijectionExamples}, while showing that $g$ was a surjection, we nearly computed the inverse of $g$.
    Putting together the work we did there, it is not difficult to see that \[ g^{-1}(u,v) = \left( \frac{ u+v}{2}, \frac{u-v}{2} \right)\,.\]
