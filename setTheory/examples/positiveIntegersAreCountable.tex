\begin{exmp}
\label{exmp:positiveIntegersAreCountable}
  The set of positive integers, $\ZZ^+$ is countable.

  To show that $\ZZ^+$ is countable, we must show that either $\ZZ^+$ is finite or $\vert \ZZ^+\vert = \vert  \NN\vert$.

  Clearly, $\ZZ^+$ is not finite.

  To show that $\vert\ZZ^+\vert = \vert\NN\vert$, we must produce a bijection from $\NN$ to $\ZZ^+$ (the order doesn't really matter here, see Lemma \ref{prop:cardinalityIsSymmetric}).
  Certainly, the mapping $x\mapsto x+1$ suffices.
