\label{exmp:setEqualityBySubsets}
  Let \[ A := \set{ 2a \mid a\in\ZZ } \] and \[ B := \set{ 2b-2\mid b\in\ZZ }\,. \]

  Fix $x\in A$.
  As $x\in A$, $x=2a$ for some $a\in\ZZ$.
  As $a\in\ZZ$, $a+1\in\ZZ$.
  Set $b = a+1$, and observe that
  \begin{align*}
    x &= 2a \\
      &= 2a + 2 - 2 \\
      &= 2(a+1) - 2 \\
      &= 2b - 2\,,
  \end{align*}
  showing that that $x\in B$.
  So, as $x$ was arbitrary, $A\subseteq B$.

  Now, fix $x\in B$.
  As $x\in B$, $x = 2b-2$ for some $b\in \ZZ$.
  Set $a = b-1$, and as $b\in\ZZ$ $a\in\ZZ$ as well.
  Finally,
  \begin{align*}
    x &= 2b-2 \\
      &= 2b - 2 + 2 - 2 \\
      &= 2(b-1) \\
      &= 2a\,,
  \end{align*}
  showing that $x\in A$.
  So, as $x$ was arbitrary, $B\subseteq A$.

  Thus, as $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$, $A=B$.
