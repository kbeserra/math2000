  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $f:\RR\to\RR$ defined as $f(x) = 4x-1$ is surjective.\\
    Fix any $y\in \RR$.
    Our job is to find some $x\in\RR$ such that $f(x)=y$.
    Given our selection of $y$, set $x = \frac{y+1}{4}$.
    We claim that this $x$ works,
    \begin{align*}
      f(x)  &=  4x-1 \\
            &=  4\frac{y+1}{4} - 1 \\
            &=  y+1 - 1 \\
            &=  y\,.
    \end{align*}
    Thus, for each $y\in\RR$ we can find some $x\in\RR$ such that $f(x)=y$.
    Thus, $f$ is surjective.

    \item Show that $g:\RR\to\RR$ defined by $g(x)=x^2$ is not surjective.\\
    To do this, we need only produce some $y\in\RR$ such that there does not exist a $x\in\RR$ such that $g(x)=y$.
    Consider $y=-1$.
    Note, $\forall x\in\RR$ $x^2\geq 0$, thus there does not exist an $x\in\RR$ such that $g(x)=-1$.
    Thus, $g$ is not surjective.

    Note, we can change the codomain of $g$ to make the function surjective.
    How?
