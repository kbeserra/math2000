\begin{exmp}
\label{exmp:evenIntegersHaveSameCardinalityAsIntegers}
  The set of even integers, $2\ZZ=\set{2z\mid z\in\ZZ}$, has the same cardinality as $\ZZ$.

  That is, $\vert 2\ZZ\vert = \vert\ZZ\vert$.
  To show this, we must produce a bijection from $2\ZZ$ to $\ZZ$.
  Note that the function $f:2\ZZ\to\ZZ$ defined by $f(z) = \frac{z}{2}$ for each $z\in\ZZ$ is a bijection.
