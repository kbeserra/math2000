\begin{defn}
\label{defn:finite}
\index{finite}
  A sets $A$ is said to be \emph{finite} provided $A$ has the same cardinality as an initials segment of the naturals.
  Suppose $A$ is finite and has the same cardinality as $\set{ m\in\NN\mid m<n}$ for some $n\in\NN$, then we say that $\vert A\vert = n$.
