  Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets.
  We say that $f\subseteq X\times Y$ is a \emph{function} from a set $X$ to a set $Y$, denoted $f:X\to Y$, is a relation from $X$ to $Y$ such that every element of $x$ is related to exactly one element in $Y$.
  For $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$, $y$ is the unique value related to $x$ if, and only if, $(x,y)\in f$.
  In this case, we say that $f(x)=y$ or $f:x\mapsto y$.
