\begin{defn}
\label{defn:tuple}
\index{tuple}
  Let $n\in\ZZ^+$ and $x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n$ be given.
  Then, the \emph{$n$-tuple}, often just \emph{tuple}, $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ is the collection containing $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ together with their order.
\label{defn:orderedPair}
\index{ordered pair}
  A $2$-tuple is called an \emph{ordered pair}.
\label{defn:orderedTriple}
\index{ordered triple}
  A $3$-tuple is called an \emph{ordered triple}.
