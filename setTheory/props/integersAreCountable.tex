\begin{prop}
\label{prop:integersAreCountable}
  The set of integers, $\ZZ$, is countable.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  To show that $\ZZ$ is countable, we must show that either $\ZZ$ is finite or $\vert \ZZ\vert=\vert \NN\vert$.
  To show that $\vert\ZZ\vert=\vert\NN\vert$ we will produce, explicitly, a bijection from $\ZZ$ to $\NN$.
  To do this, we will keep $0$ where it is, map the negative integers to the even natural numbers, and the positive integers to the odd natural numbers.

  One such mapping is $f:\ZZ\to\NN$ defined be \[ f(z) = \begin{cases}
      0 & z= 0 \\
      -2z & z<0 \\
      2z-1 & z>0
   \end{cases}\,. \]
   It remains to show that this mapping has the desired properties.
   This is left as an exercise to the reader.
\end{proof}
