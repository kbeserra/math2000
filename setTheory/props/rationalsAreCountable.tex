\begin{prop}
\label{prop:rationalsAreCountable}
  The set of rationals, $\QQ$, is countable.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  We will show this in steps.
  Assume that we have constructed a bijection $f:\ZZ^+\to \QQ^+$.
  Note this map, after multiplying by $-1$, sees that negative rationals are have the same cardinality as $\ZZ$ as well.
  Now, with this bijection, we can form a bijection $g:\ZZ\to\QQ$ defined as as \[ g(z) = \begin{cases}
      0 & z= 0 \\
      -f(z) & z<0 \\
      f(z) & z>0
   \end{cases} \]
   for each $z\in\ZZ$.
   With this bijection in hand, we use the fact that $\ZZ$ is countable, Proposition \ref{prop:integersAreCountable}, together with Proposition \ref{prop:cardinalityIsTransitive} to obtain that $\QQ$ is countable.

   So, it remains to show that there is a bijection $f:\ZZ^+\to\QQ^+$.
   (There is a classic zig-zag argument which informally describes such a bijection. This zig-zagging can be made formal, and a closed form of that description can be written. I will present that in lecture, but for the notes I will show a different way.)
   As $\ZZ^+\subset \QQ^+$, there exists, trivially, an injection $\ZZ^+\to\QQ^+$.
\end{proof}
