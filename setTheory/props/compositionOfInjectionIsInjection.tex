\begin{prop}
\label{prop:compositionOfInjectionIsInjection}
  If $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ are both injective, then $g\circ f$ is injective.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Fix any $x,y\in X$ and suppose that $x\not=y$.
  As $f$ is injective and $x\not=y$, $f(x)\not=f(y)$.
  As $g$ is injective, and $f(x),f(y)\in Y$ are distinct, $g(f(x))\not= g(f(y))$.
  Thus, $g\circ f$ is injective.
\end{proof}
