\begin{prop}
\label{prop:compositionOfBijectionsIsBijection}
  If $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ are both bijective, then $g\circ f$ is bijective.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  As $f$ and $g$ are bijections, they are both surjective and injective.
  Thus, by applying Propositions \ref{prop:compositionOfSurjectionIsSurjection} and \ref{prop:compositionOfInjectionIsInjection}, we have that $g\circ f$ is a surjective and injective.
  Thus, as $g\circ f$ is a bijection.
\end{proof}
