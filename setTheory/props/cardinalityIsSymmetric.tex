\begin{prop}
\label{prop:cardinalityIsSymmetric}
  For any sets $A$ and $B$ if $A$ has the same cardinality as $B$, then $B$ has the same cardinality as $A$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Fix sets $A$ and $B$, and suppose that $A$ has the same cardinality as $B$.
  As $A$ has the same cardinality as $B$, there exists a bijection $f$ from $A$ to $B$.
  As $f$ is a bijection, Proposition \ref{prop:inverseOfBijectionIsBijection} gives that $f^{-1}$ is a bijection from $B$ to $A$.
  Whence, $B$ has the same cardinality as $A$.
\end{proof}
