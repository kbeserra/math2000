\begin{prop}
\label{prop:compositionOfSurjectionIsSurjection}
  If $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ are both surjective, then $g\circ f$ is surjective.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Fix any $z\in Z$.
  As $g$ is surjective, there exists some $y\in Y$ such that $g(y)=z$.
  As $f$ is surjective, there exists some $x\in X$ such that $f(x)=z$.
  Now, we note that
  \begin{align*}
    (g\circ f)(x) &= g(f(x)) \\
                  &= g(y) \\
                  &= z\,.
  \end{align*}
  Showing that $g\circ f$ is surjective.
\end{proof}
