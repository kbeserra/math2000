\begin{prop}
\label{prop:sizeOfFinitePowerset}
  For all $n\in\NN$, if $X$ is a set with $n$ elements, then $\mathcal{P}$ has $2^n$ elements.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  We prove this by induction on $n$.

  In the case where $n=0$.
  Then, the only set with $0$ elements is the emptyset.
  We now see \[\mathcal{P}(\emptyset) = \set{\emptyset} \,\] has $2^0=1$ elements.

  Now, suppose $n\in\NN$ and the power set of any set with $n$ elements has  $2^n$ elements.
  Let $X$ be a set with $n+1$ many elements.
  As $X$ has $n+1$ many elements, there exists some $x\in X$.
  Fix any $x\in X$.

  Note, $X\setminus\set{x}$ has $n$ elements.
  So, by our inductive hypothesis $\mathcal{P}(X\setminus\set{x})$ has $2^n$ elements.

  $\mathcal{P}(X\setminus\set{x})$ contains half of the elements in $\mathcal{P}(X)$.
  In particular, it is missing all the subsets of $X$ which contain $x$.
  Note \[ \mathcal{P}(X) = \mathcal{P}(X\setminus\set{x}) \cup \set{ A\cup\set{x} \mid A\in \mathcal{P}(X\setminus\set{x}) }\,.\]
  As $\mathcal{P}(X\setminus\set{x})$ has $2^n$ elements, $\set{ A\cup\set{x} \mid A\in \mathcal{P}(X\setminus\set{x}) }$ has $2^n$ many elements.
  Further, as each element of $\mathcal{P}(X\setminus\set{x})$ does not contain $x$ and each element of $\set{ A\cup\set{x} \mid A\in \mathcal{P}(X\setminus\set{x}) }$ does, those two sets are disjoint.
  This, $\mathcal{P}(X)$ has $2\cdot 2^n=2^{n+1}$ elements.
\end{proof}
